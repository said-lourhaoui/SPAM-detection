# SPAM-detection
This project implements the following algorithms to detect whether an email is a spam or not : 
- Beta-binomial Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Logistic regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Data description
The data is an email spam dataset, consisting of 4601 email messages with 57 features. Feature
descriptions are found in this link. We have divided the data into a training set (3065 emails)
and test set (1536 emails) with accompanying labels (1 = spam , 0 = not spam).

## How to run the code ?
* Place the script and the data file (spamData.mat) in the same directory.
* Make sure the following modules are installed : scipy, numpy, matplotlib and sklearn.
* Use a python3 interpreter to run the code.
